3.) Then run the arduino system and then you can see the real time values updated in the data base.

## Disclaimer 

Since the sensors are available for the time being

testing database link : https://varuna-ed693-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/

you can update the values in the above database and see the working of our application.

if you have the sensors ready then you may have to change the arduino code file's contents.
You have to change the firebase host to above testing base link and firebase auth to "AIzaSyB4_HcX7LuXeq2ERot6BsnJJMg5BNSBtFE."
